I'm Archit Bhise and I'm interested in startups, marketing and investing.

I'm interested in first principle approaches to solving problems and am a [big fan of people who disagree with me](http://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/).

In a previous life, I was a venture capitalist focused on investing in hard-tech and consumer startups. I also founded [Wellframe](http://www.wellframe.com/) and served as the Chief Product Officer. We built software that uses artificial intelligence to help high-risk patients recover from complex diseases - heart attacks, organ transplants, COPD, and more.

Quick academic background: I graduated from [MIT](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) and I've previously worked with [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/tem/).

I'm always up for a coffee to find out more about what you are working on, so feel free to [get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Coffee?)!
