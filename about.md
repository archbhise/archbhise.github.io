I'm Archit Bhise and I work at [Wellframe](http://wellframe.com).

I'm interested in first principle approaches to solving problems and am a [big fan of people who disagree with me](http://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/). 

I code a lot in Ruby, and have recently been dabbling with Haskell.

I graduated from [MIT](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/). I've previously worked with [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/tem/).
