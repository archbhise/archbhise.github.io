I'm Archit Bhise and I'm currently a venture capitalist at [Redpoint Ventures](http://www.redpoint.com/). I'm interested in first principle approaches to solving problems and am a [big fan of people who disagree with me](http://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/). I love startups that enable new markets through a step function that leverages a 10x product or technology differentiation.

In a previous life, I founded [Wellframe](http://www.wellframe.com/) and served as the Chief Product Officer. We built software that uses artificial intelligence to help high-risk patients recover from complex diseases - heart attacks, organ transplants, COPD, and more.

Quick academic background: I graduated from [MIT](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) and I've previously worked with [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/tem/).

I'm always up for a coffee to find out more about what you are working on, so feel free to get in touch!
