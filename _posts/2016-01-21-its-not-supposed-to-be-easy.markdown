<p>Hi! I’m Archit and I recently joined Redpoint Ventures as an early-stage investor.</p>
 
<p>Quick background on me:
I’ve been interested in the magic of technology for as long as I can remember. Fascinated by games, I learned to code when I was in elementary school and then proceeded to wreck havoc on my dad’s laptop. In college, I had the chance to hone my skills for good and ended up majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT.</p>
 
<p>During college, I fell in love with the art of founding companies, though the exact idea I wanted to work on seemed elusive. I sought to tackle a problem in a space that looked complicated, messy and where technology could make a real difference. Ultimately, I had the pleasure of working with Jon Gruber who sparked my interest in healthcare. Soon, I found there were large problems in healthcare that could be solved by leveraging the power of technology. I used this experience to found Wellframe, to help people recover from complex diseases such as heart disease or organ transplants using artificial intelligence to re-engineer care delivery.</p>
 
Step by step, I learned that building a great business is not just about the product, but rather several other details: working with an incredible team, getting the business model right, sorting out any operational kinks, aligning incentives, and more.

When I left Wellframe and was trying to figure out what do next, there was only one thing I knew for sure - I wanted to find a way to help incredible people who were using their skills to tackle big, hairy problems.
 
As I start my journey on the other side, I’d like to kick-off this blog with a small sentiment that Charlie Munger has often expressed about entrepreneurship and investing.

<blockquote>“It’s not supposed to be easy”</blockquote>
 
The best entrepreneurs often go on a tumultuous journey before their company becomes a success. Elon Musk almost lost his company before Tesla was able to go public. Tim Westergren from Pandora pitched over 300 investors before he received funding. Dustin Moskovitz put it aptly: "If by overnight success you mean staying up and coding all night, every night for six years straight, then it felt quite tiring and stressful.”
 
The same, to a lesser extent, is true for investors. You need to often be willing to look wrong for quite a few years before the market understands your thesis.
 
There are several hurdles you need to clear to build a great business. I plan to use this blog as a way to talk about what I learn and disseminate thoughts on those very challenges that will hopefully spark a good conversation for all readers.
